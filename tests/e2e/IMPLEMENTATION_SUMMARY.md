## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (required first time)
npx playwright install
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run Specific Test File

```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/news-browsing.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/auth-and-settings.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/rotation.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/rss-management.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/user-journey.spec.ts
```

### Run in Headed Mode

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Run for Specific Browser

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Chrome"
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Safari"
```

### Debug Tests

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

### View Test Report

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Test Configuration

Tests are configured in `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- **Automatic dev server**: Starts before tests
- **Retry**: 2 retries on CI
- **Screenshots**: On failure
- **Traces**: On first retry

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage

- All major user flows tested
- Multiple browsers and devices
- Accessibility checks
- Error handling

### 2. Realistic Scenarios

- Actual user interactions
- Navigation flows
- State persistence
- Performance metrics

### 3. Mobile Testing

- Responsive layouts
- Mobile-specific features
- Touch target sizes

### 4. Accessibility

- ARIA attributes
- Heading hierarchy
- Alt text verification

### 5. Error Handling

- Invalid URLs
- 404 pages
- Console errors
- Navigation errors

## Authentication Testing Notes

Current tests verify redirect behavior for protected routes. For full authenticated flow testing, consider:

1. **Playwright Authentication**: Use `storageState` to persist auth
2. **Mock Authentication**: Mock NextAuth API responses
3. **Test User**: Use dedicated test account credentials

Example setup is documented in `tests/e2e/README.md`.

## Known Limitations

1. **Browser Installation**: Requires `npx playwright install` before first run
2. **Authentication**: Tests verify redirects; full auth flows need setup
3. **External APIs**: Tests don't mock external news APIs
4. **Database**: Tests don't interact with real database

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add API mocking for external services
- [ ] Set up test authentication
- [ ] Add visual regression testing
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add accessibility audits (axe-core)
- [ ] Add network condition testing
- [ ] Add internationalization testing
