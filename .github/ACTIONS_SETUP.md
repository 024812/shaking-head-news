Go to: `https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO]/settings/branches`

### Protect `main` Branch

- [ ] Click "Add rule"
- [ ] Branch name pattern: `main`
- [ ] Enable the following:

#### Pull Request Requirements

  - [ ] Require approvals: 1
  - [ ] Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed

#### Status Checks
- [ ] ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
  - [ ] ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - [ ] Add required status checks:
    - [ ] `Lint & Format Check`
    - [ ] `TypeScript Type Check`
    - [ ] `Unit & Integration Tests`
    - [ ] `Build Application`

#### Additional Settings
- [ ] ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- [ ] ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
- [ ] ✅ Restrict who can push to matching branches (optional)

- [ ] Click "Create" or "Save changes"

### Protect `develop` Branch (Optional)

  - [ ] Select "Read and write permissions"
  - [ ] ✅ Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
  - [ ] Click "Save"

## 6. Test the Pipeline

### Create Test Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to test branch
git checkout -b test/ci-pipeline

# Make a small change
echo "<!-- CI/CD test -->" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin test/ci-pipeline
```

### Create Pull Request

- [ ] Go to GitHub repository
- [ ] Click "Compare & pull request"
- [ ] Create PR from `test/ci-pipeline` to `develop` or `main`
- [ ] Watch the CI/CD pipeline run

### Verify Pipeline Steps

- [ ] ✅ Lint & Format Check passes
- [ ] ✅ TypeScript Type Check passes
- [ ] ✅ Unit & Integration Tests pass
- [ ] ✅ E2E Tests pass
- [ ] ✅ Build Application succeeds
- [ ] ✅ Security Audit completes
- [ ] ✅ Deploy Preview succeeds
- [ ] ✅ Preview URL commented on PR
- [ ] ✅ Lighthouse CI runs (if enabled)

### Verify Codecov (if configured)

- [ ] Coverage report appears in PR
- [ ] Coverage badge shows in PR checks
- [ ] Coverage diff shows for changed files

### Test Production Deployment

- [ ] Merge PR to `main`
- [ ] Verify production deployment triggers
